---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Feature Part: Several Third-Party Logistic Service Integrations

#### Context
Dispatching orders to third-party logistic services to ehance delivery coverage and efficiency.

#### Order Flow Chain
- Event-driven Chain
- Order Service -> Outsource Service -> Third Party Logistic Service

#### How to sync order status?
- Provided a webhook (public endpoint) to the third-party logistic service
- Actively fetched their status API periodically

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Feature Part: Outsource Service

#### Context
Built an Outsourced Partner Service to centralize integrations, abstracting their individual configurations behind a unified interface.

#### Takeaway
- Not every partner integration warrants a standalone microservice, especially when they share similar business logic and the integration is lightweight.


---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)

### New Order Service
Backward-Compatible Core Order Service transitioning to Event-Driven Architecture.

#### Tasks
- Event Sourcing
- DB tuning by analyzing SQL plan
- Zero-downtime Migration w/ Soft Launch Strategy
- Latest Event as Order Status -> Could be improved
- Many Join among Tables -> Could be improved
- Key Value Pairs in RDB -> Could be improved
- Unresolved Distributed Transaction -> Could be improved
- Fat Controller -> Could be improved


After studying more about system design, I believe my initial approach back then could be improved with at least one of the optimal solution, if there is one, in the following "New Order Service" pages. Otherwise, the task listed in that page is just a showcase.

---

###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Event Sourcing<br/>

- Built event sourcing pattern to track fine-grained internal status changes
- Enabled a complete timeline of order status
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:100%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/orderStatusTimeline.jpg" alt="timeline">
</div>

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: DB tuning by Analyzing SQL Plan <br>
- Analyzed SQL plan and updated Index, reducing average active sessions (AAS) to almost zero.
- Indexes that has been used: Composite, Covering (INCLUDE), Partial (WHERE), Unique, GIN , B-tree
- SQL plan good sign: Uses Index Scan or Index Only Scan, No Seq Scan (full table scan), No additional Sort operations...
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:95%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/dbLoad.png" alt="db_load">
</div>


---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Zero-downtime Migration w/ Soft Launch Strategy<br/>
- Four phases migration strategy:
  - Dual write to old and new system, read from old system
  - Write to new system, transform to old system, read from old system
  - Write to new system, transform to old system, read from new system
  - Write to new system, read from new system, deprecate old system
- Legacy order data is retained for historical querying and auditing purposes.

###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Single Source of Truth or Performance<br/>

A difficult choice between performance and data consistency is always hard.
<br/>
Do we want to maintain two copy of data for query performance?

My thought: for data that is not frequently updated, yes.
Like materilized view, we can maintain two copy of data for query performance.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:50%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/SSOT.jpg" alt="ssot">
</div> -->

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Latest Event as Order Status

#### Initial Approach: Latest Event
We calculated the latest event directly from event sourcing table.
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:80%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/orderStatusTimeline.jpg" alt="timeline">
</div>

#### Optimal Approach: Apply Event to Single State
Could query a single status field, updating when status changes
<div style="display:inline-block; ">
  <img style="width:48%;vertical-align: top;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/orderStatusInOrder.jpg" alt="event_sourcing">
<img style="width:48%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/singleOrderStatus.jpg" alt="event_sourcing">
</div>

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Many Joins among Tables

If data is not growing fast, e.g. < 10K rows, it is fine.

#### Initial Approach:
- Six distinct tables were utilized to store order-related data.
- It required many joins to fetch one complete order data

#### Optimal Approach: The Join/Growth Trade-Off
- Stable, Slow-growth Tables
  - Multiple Joins (Prioritize ACID/Normalization)   
- Fast-growing, Read-heavy Tables (e.g., Orders/History) 
  - Multiple Joins are Detrimental to Performance.
  - Implement specialized read solutions, e.g. denormalization, caching, or materialized views.


---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Key-value Pairs in RDB
#### Initial Approach: A Failed Experience.
We designed and implemented the EAV model for secondary order attributes, ensuring high flexibility and extensibility across different order types.
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:40%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/keyValuePair.jpg" alt="key_value_pair">
</div>

#### Pain points and should not be used in RDB: 
- Lack of referential integrity constraints and type safety
- Added complexity at application level for data retrieval and manipulation
- Resulting in finding item from array instead of key in map
- High vertical growth (10+ rows per entity) leads to an extremely fast-growing table and severely reduced query performance.
- JSONB in PostgreSQL is a better alternative

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Unresolved Distributed Transaction
#### Initial Approach
Implemented an event-driven architecture with Nats JetStream only
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:70%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/newEventChain.jpg" alt="migration">
</div>

#### Optimal Approach
- Robust Messaging (NATS JetStream with built in Raft)
  - Ensure reliable message persistence.
- Local Resilience (Retry Queue + Dead Letter Queue (DLQ))
  - Handle and triage transient failures.
- Global Coordination (Saga Pattern)
  - Execute compensating transactions for permanent business failure.

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Existing Tech Debt: Fat Controller<br/>
#### Initial Approach:
- We have a fat controller that handles multiple layers of logic: gRPC call, ORM call, business logic, service call
- Not easy to maintain and test
#### Optimal Approach: 
- Clean Architecture (implemented in my LZStock project)
<div style="display:inline-block;text-align: center;">

###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Admin Order Detail Page<br/>
A native Context/Reducer pattern with Hooks API, replacing Redux and Saga approach.

###### Work Experience @PG (2017-2019)
### Git Flow

##### Simplified Git Workflow for small project:
  - First step is always checkouting a new branch from master.
  - Merge feature branch into Prod.
  - Merge Production branch into Stage branch regularly, but don't merge stage branch into prod. branch.
  - Staging branch is only for testing purpose.

###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Project Overview
An internal SPA for the purpose of setting and reading prices in terms of each product in the online shop.

#### Features
- Supported with create/read/update/delete operation for promotions.
- Supported auto sign in with Google OAuth 2.0.
- Visual dashboard for marketing team to manage promotions.

#### What have I learned? (2025 Revision)
- Should sync with existing product, and leveraging import instead of manually input each campaign
- Redis is overkill here
- Should leverage gRPC/tRPC instead of REST for internal communication

###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Tech
#### Front End (Web service)

##### Structure
- Take advantage of the power of Webpack for packaging web service in dev and prod. environment instead of directly using CRA.
- React-Redux best practice (e.g. layout, route and page as component for more flexibility.)
- Separate Redux's mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps from every component in order to make it easy to understand.

##### Web Server
- Use nginx as static file server in production environment.
- JSON-server for serving a mock data.

---
###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Tech
#### Back End (User / Promotions / Prices / Upgrade-rules Services)
##### Auth:
- Google OAuth 2.0


##### Structure:
- Best practice of Node/Express with ES6 syntax(e.g. self-contained components as file structure, bind API at router level).
- Every route has implemented Redis as cache server to reduce DB's query operation.


##### Cache:
- Thanks to Redis, no extra DB query command is executed when post/update/delete router has been called and still can return a full list of promotion.

##### Proxy:
- Use NGINX as a reverse proxy.

---
###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Tech
#### DevOps
##### Container
- Use Docker-compose to run dev on local
- Multi-container structure
- Use $(git rev-parse HEAD) to tag container in order to track version.
- K8S

##### CI:
- Travis

##### Cloud:
- AWS ECS
- GCP GKE
