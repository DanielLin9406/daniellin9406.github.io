###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)

### Backbone Service: Strategic Transformation
- Core of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
  - Decoupled "Old Order Service" into Backbone and Last-leg services; delegated dispatching and trip logic.
  - Refined scope: Focused on Order, Parcel, Waypoint, and Append-only Tracking Timeline.
	- System Hub: Leveraged durable messaging to synchronize Wallet, Warehouse, and Outsource modules.
	- Read-Oriented Service: Optimized for high-frequency queries (e.g., `getOrder`, `getOrders`).
- Migration Strategy and Adapter Wrapper
  - Backward-compatible adapters to transform data between the input source and the backbone, and from the backbone into the legacy order system.
  - Zero-Downtime Migration
---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)

### Backbone Service: Deep Dive in Technical Execution

- High-Availability & Scale Engineering
  - Benefit of EDA
  - Query Optimization: Approaches we had and Lesson Learned
  - Zero-downtime Migration w/ Soft Launch Strategy

  - Order Status Retrieval (Fixed)
  - The Joins vs. Scale Trade-off (Fixed)
  - The EAV Model Trap (Fixed)
  - Distributed Transaction Resilience
  - Decoupling the "Fat Controller"

---

###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Backbone Service: Benefit of EDA<br/>
- Elastic Scaling: Decoupled consumption allows downstream services (Wallet, Warehouse) to handle spikes via Load Leveling without stressing the Backbone.
- Data Integrity & Traceability: Append-only event streams provide a naturally immutable audit trail for the entire order lifecycle, simplifying complex dispute resolutions.

###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Backbone Service: Query Optimization & Scalability<br>

- Performance Engineering (Then)
	- Issue Identification: Utilized AWS Performance Insights to pinpoint high-latency SQL and analyzed execution plans for optimization.
	- Indexing Strategy: Optimized query by implementing targeted indexes
	- Load Distribution: Leveraged RDS Read Replicas (1 Main, 2 Replicas) 
- Strategic Evolution (Now)
  - Moving toward Denormalization and optimized schemas to reduce complex join overhead. 
  - Evaluating Database Partitioning for long growing table like event sourcing table
  - Leveraging Sharding when single database won't work
  - Leveraging Redis for sub-millisecond hot-path queries and ElasticSearch for complex, multi-dimensional searches across millions of records.

###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Backbone Service: Zero-downtime Migration w/ Soft Launch Strategy<br/>

- Four phases Migration
  - Phase 1: Dual-write; Read from Legacy (Baseline consistency check).
  - Phase 2: Write to New Service; Async-sync to Legacy; Read from Legacy.
  - Phase 3: Primary Write to New Service; Read from New Service.
  - Phase 4: Full Cutover & Legacy Deprecation.

###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Backbone Retrospective: Order Status Retrieval (Fixed)

#### Initial Approach: Calculated order status on-the-fly
As the event table grew to millions of rows, the `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1` queries became extremely expensive, even with indexing.
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:80%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/orderStatusTimeline.jpg" alt="timeline">
</div>

#### Optimal Approach: Single State model
The latest status is now applied and persisted to a dedicated field in the orders table.

  <img style="width:48%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/singleOrderStatus.jpg" alt="event_sourcing">
</div>

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Backbone Retrospective: The Join vs. Growth Trade-off (Fixed)

#### Initial Approach: Strict Normalization
- Architecture: Data spread across 6 distinct tables to ensure strict ACID compliance.
- Challenge: Fetching a single "Complete Order" required expensive 6-way joins, which became a bottleneck as the dataset matured.

#### Optimal Approach: The Join/Growth Trade-Off 
- Stable Data (`<`10K rows): 
  - Maintain Normalization; joins are acceptable for consistency and storage efficiency.
- Fast-growing Data (Orders/History): 
  - Shift to Denormalized Read Models. Implemented specialized read solutions (Materialized Views/JSONB caching) to flatten complex relationships.

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Backbone Retrospective: The EAV Model Trap (Fixed)
#### Initial Approach
Implemented the EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) model for secondary attributes to ensure maximum schema flexibility across different order types.

#### Pain Points: The Reality
- Integrity & Type Safety: Lost database-level constraints and data typing.
- Performance Degradation: Massive vertical growth (10+ rows per order) led to table bloat and index inefficiency.
- Application Complexity: Forced to perform data transformation and "array searching" logic in the code.

#### Optimal Approach
- Column-based approach for core fields.
- Leveraged JSONB in PostgreSQL for semi-structured data, providing a balance between flexibility, GIN indexing, and data integrity.

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Backbone Retrospective: Distributed Transaction Resilience
#### Initial Approach
Leveraged Nats JetStream (Raft-based) to ensure high-availability and persistent message delivery within the Event-driven architecture.

#### The Unresolved Challenge
While messages were persisted, handling downstream business failures (e.g., payment failure, inventory shortage) remained complex.

#### Optimal Approach
- Local Resilience: 
  - Implemented Retry Queues and Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) to triage and recover from transient network/service failures.
- Global Coordination: 
  - Transitioning toward the Saga Pattern (Choreography-based) to manage compensating transactions for permanent business logic failures.

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Backbone Retrospective: Decoupling the "Fat Controller"<br/>
#### Initial Approach: The Monolithic Controller
- Anti-pattern: A single controller handled gRPC communication, ORM mapping, business logic, and downstream service calls.
- Pain Points: Highly coupled code, difficult to unit test, and high maintenance overhead for new features.

#### Optimal Approach: Clean Architecture Implementation
- Applied these principles in my LZStock (Golang) project.

###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Backbone Service UI: Admin Order Detail Page<br/>
- Strategic Shift: Replaced the legacy Redux + Saga architecture with a native Context API / useReducer pattern.
- Enhanced Scalability: Built a custom Hook-based architecture to encapsulate complex domain logic, ensuring the UI remains thin and reactive.

###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Project Overview
An internal SPA for the purpose of setting and reading prices in terms of each product in the online shop.

#### Features
- Supported with create/read/update/delete operation for promotions.
- Supported auto sign in with Google OAuth 2.0.
- Visual dashboard for marketing team to manage promotions.

#### What have I learned? (2025 Revision)
- Should sync with existing product, and leveraging import instead of manually input each campaign
- Redis is overkill here
- Should leverage gRPC/tRPC instead of REST for internal communication

###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Tech
#### Front End (Web service)

##### Structure
- Take advantage of the power of Webpack for packaging web service in dev and prod. environment instead of directly using CRA.
- React-Redux best practice (e.g. layout, route and page as component for more flexibility.)
- Separate Redux's mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps from every component in order to make it easy to understand.

##### Web Server
- Use nginx as static file server in production environment.
- JSON-server for serving a mock data.

---
###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Tech
#### Back End (User / Promotions / Prices / Upgrade-rules Services)
##### Auth:
- Google OAuth 2.0


##### Structure:
- Best practice of Node/Express with ES6 syntax(e.g. self-contained components as file structure, bind API at router level).
- Every route has implemented Redis as cache server to reduce DB's query operation.


##### Cache:
- Thanks to Redis, no extra DB query command is executed when post/update/delete router has been called and still can return a full list of promotion.

##### Proxy:
- Use NGINX as a reverse proxy.

---
###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Tech
#### DevOps
##### Container
- Use Docker-compose to run dev on local
- Multi-container structure
- Use $(git rev-parse HEAD) to tag container in order to track version.
- K8S

##### CI:
- Travis

##### Cloud:
- AWS ECS
- GCP GKE

### Developing Process
#### Step 3: Implement entry point:
- Back-end API
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
  -> database
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
  -> front-end
</p>
<br />
- Front-end with mock data server

### Developing Process
#### Step 3: Develop back end API:

Although complexity of individual API may be different from case to case, I take an API as unit.
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
- Build API router based on sequence diagram (Write schema and resolve to create graphql-server)
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0">
- Build a mock data and return response.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0">
- Integrate 3rd API if needed.
</p>
