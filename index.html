###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)

### New Order Service
#### Tasks
- Latest Event as Order Status
- Many Join among Tables
- Index Missing Hit
- Performance or Single Source of Truth
- System Migration
- Event Sequence
- Fault Tolerance

#### Reflections
That are all the tasks related to new order service I did at Pickupp. However, after returning to school and studying more about system design, I believe my initial approach back then could be improved with at least one of the optimal solution, if there is one, in the following "New Order Service" pages. Otherwise, the task listed in that page is just a showcase.


---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Latest Event as Order Status

#### Initial Approach: Latest Event
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:60%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/orderStatusTimeline.jpg" alt="timeline">
</div>

#### Optimal Approach: Apply Event to Single State
<img style="width:100%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/orderStatus.jpg" alt="event_sourcing">
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:60%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/orderStatusInOrder.jpg" alt="event_sourcing">
</div>
---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Key Value Pairs in RDB

#### Initial Approach: Key-Value in SQL
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:50%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/keyValuePair.jpg" alt="key_value_pair">
</div>

#### Pain points: 
- Lack of referential integrity constraints
- Lack of advantages in structured queries
- Challenges in maintenance and scalability
  - Application logic may need to be updated if new attributes added or changed
- Difficulty in reporting and analysis
- Data redundancy and inconsistency
- Find item from array instead of key in object


---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Index Missing Hit <br>
Fix SQL queries without proper indexing and reducing average active sessions (AAS) by 72% (from 0.9 to 0.25) 
<img style="width:100%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/dbLoad.png" alt="db_load">

Other Indexes that has been used:<br/>
Composite, Covering (INCLUDE), Partial (WHERE), Unique, GIN , B-tree

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Performance or Single Source of Truth<br/>

A difficult choice between performance and data consistency is always hard.
<br/>
Do we want to maintain two copy of data for query performance?

My thought: for data that is not frequently updated, yes.
Like materilized view, we can maintain two copy of data for query performance.

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:50%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/SSOT.jpg" alt="ssot">
</div>

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: System Migration<br/>
- Double Write Method
  - Write to both old and new system
  - Read from old system
- Build a transformation layer between new and old system
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:50%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/migration.jpg" alt="migration">
</div>

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Service: Event Sourcing
#### Initial Approach: 
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:80%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/eventChain.jpg" alt="migration">
</div>

#### Optimal Approach: Distributed Transaction
- TC/C or Saga
  - Rollback
  - Parallel or Linear Execution (Depends)
- Fault Tolerance
  - Raft Node Group

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### New Order Detail Page<br/>
Native Reducer + useContext/useState Hooks
<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="width:60%;" src="./statics/img/Pickupp/orderDetailPage.jpg" alt="order_detail_page">
</div>

---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Feature Part: Third Party Service Integration

#### Status Synchronization Methods
- Provide a webhook (public endpoint) to the third party logistic service to update order status on our system
- Actively retrieve API status from them to sync order status on our system


---
###### Work Experience @Pickupp (2021-2023)
### Existing Tech Debt: Fat Controller<br/>
#### Initial Approach:
- gRPC call
- ORM call
- business logic
- service call

#### Optimal Approach: 
- Clean Architecture
- Already learned as a takeaway and implemented in my LZStock project

###### Work Experience @PG (2017-2019)
### Git Flow

##### Situation:
<p style="font-size:1rem;margin-bottom:0;">
  - Single feature should have their own developing branch.
</p>
<p style="font-size:1rem;margin-bottom:0;">
  - Some features had been developed but not going live soon until the idea has been approved by marketing team member.
</p>
<p style="font-size:1rem;margin-bottom:0;">
  - Website needs to be updated and deployed as fast as possible.
</p>


<img src="./statics/img/PG/customized-git-workflow.jpg" alt="git-flow">

---
###### Work Experience @PG (2017-2019)
### Git Flow

##### Idea:
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
  - First step is always checkouting a new branch from master.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
  - Run `git rebase prod-branch` before merging feature branch into stage branch or prod. branch. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
  - Don't directly merge stage branch into prod. branch. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
  - You can treat stage branch as a pre-prod. branch, but one thing you should be noticed that not all features which has been merged into stage are becoming part of our official release. 
</p>

### Tech
#### Front End (Web service)

##### Structure
- Take advantage of the power of Webpack for packaging web service in dev and prod. environment instead of directly using CRA.
- React-Redux best practice (e.g. layout, route and page as component for more flexibility.)
- Separate Redux's mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps from every component in order to make it easy to understand.

##### Web Server
- Use nginx as static file server in production environment.
- JSON-server for serving a mock data.

---
###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Tech
#### Back End (User / Promotions / Prices / Upgrade-rules Services)
##### Auth:
- Google OAuth 2.0


##### Structure:
- Best practice of Node/Express with ES6 syntax(e.g. self-contained components as file structure, bind API at router level).
- Every route has implemented Redis as cache server to reduce DB's query operation.


##### Cache:
- Thanks to Redis, no extra DB query command is executed when post/update/delete router has been called and still can return a full list of promotion.

##### Proxy:
- Use NGINX as a reverse proxy.

---
###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Tech
#### DevOps
##### Container
- Use Docker-compose to run dev on local
- Multi-container structure
- Use $(git rev-parse HEAD) to tag container in order to track version.
- K8S

##### CI:
- Travis

##### Cloud:
- AWS ECS
- GCP GKE

### Developing Process
#### Step 2: Planning Sequence Diagrams

<p style="font-size: 1rem;">
  - Check existing API and define new API spec.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 1rem;">
  - Define a API response's data structure.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 1rem;">
  - Deal with Authorization.

### Developing Process
#### Step 3: Implement entry point:
- Back-end API
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
  -> database
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
  -> front-end
</p>
<br />
- Front-end with mock data server

---
###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Developing Process
#### Step 3: Develop back end API:

Although complexity of individual API may be different from case to case, I take an API as unit.
<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0.2rem;">
- Build API router based on sequence diagram (Write schema and resolve to create graphql-server)
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0">
- Build a mock data and return response.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0">
- Integrate 3rd API if needed.
</p>

###### Price Dashboard (2020) [[source]](https://github.com/DanielLin9406/fullstack-priceDashboard)
### Developing Process
#### Step 3: Connect backEnd API to DB:

<p>
  - Setup DB
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0">
  - Connect to dev/prod DB
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0">
  - Build model classes
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0">
- Write seed data into DB
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0">
- Access data @API level and replace mock data
</p>
<p style="margin-top:0">
- Run unit test to api
</p>
